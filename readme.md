## Dataset

> Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used. In this project, I download data from https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data and join them together to get bike system data for whole year of 2018 to perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Ford GoBike, a bike-share system provider.

## Summary of Findings

> The distribution of duration for each trip has one peak between 300 and 1000 seconds, which is equal to 6 mins to 20 mins.
> Bike share services are used more during weekday by counts, while during weekends the services tend to be used for a longer time. We can also see that bike share service during morning on the weekday than weekend. I think most people use it for work transportation. While people use more bike in the afternoon during weekends. I think people get up late and use bike service in the afternoon.
> The trip mean value of the distribution on May to October is also higher than other month. So people not only use more service but also use for longer time during May to October.
> Subscribers are more than customers in each station. However, there are more customers at San Francisco Ferry Building (Harry Bridges Plaza) and The Embarcadero at Sansome St stations than at other stations. Customers might include tourists.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Counts of subscribers are much more than customers. This illustrate that the price of the service is reasonable for most people.
> Subscribers use the service much harder on weekday than weekend, while the duation of each is shorter on weekdays than weekends.
> Subscribers use the service harder in the morning while customers tend to use the service during afternoon.
> If we want to launch a compaign on bike sharing, information above can help us to customize our strategy to attract more people on this service.
